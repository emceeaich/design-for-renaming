Design for Renaming
===================

Emma Humphries (http://emmah.net) 

^ I work on the web to app funnel at Peel Technologies

^ Previously I've worked on web apps at Apple, enterprise web security tools at WhiteHat, and on several projects, including Identity at Linden Lab

^ I recently changed my name, and consequently have run into a variety of experiences, good and bad online as a result

Caveats
-------

^ I'm an engineer

^ I'm not a IA: I can't tell you how to redesign your views in the system

^ IANAL: This does not constitute legal advice

^ And this is, for now, a US-Centric talk

What I'm Going to Cover
-----------------------

* Why does this matter
* Rules of Thumb
  * Ask yourself what names your system need?
  * Computers are good at microaggressions
  * Everyone has many names
  * The State is Transphobic by Nature (but you don't have to be.)
* Questions

Why Does This Matter
--------------------

* The size of the issue
  * We know that for better or worse, around 80% of women-identified US residents change their name on marriage
  * Despite most States offerning 

Notes
-----

* The size of the issue
    * Number of people changing the name on their social security accounts each year
    * 7% of Americans Citizens do not have access to Birth Certificate, Naturalization Papers, or Passports (Brennan Center, 2006)
    * 48% of voting age Women with ready access to Birth Certificate have a Birth Certificate with current legal name (Brennan Center, 2006)
    *  11% of American citizens do not have government-issued photo identification (Brennan Center, 2006)
    * 48% of trans people in the US do not have identification matching their correct name (Cite)
    * 46% of American citizens have a US passport (Estmate, the Expeditioner)
    * 80% of American women change their name on marriage.
* Names manage access to things
    * Deeds and Titles
    * Digital things now: music, books, software licences, mobile apps and these things are initmate 

> @danimgrace: Take your husband’s last name. Take his first name. Take his social. Assume his identity. Hide the body in a closet. You’re the husband now. http://twitter.com/danimgrace/status/598204691374280704

Guidelines
----------

* Computers are good at Microaggressions
    * If you make a mistake with a person's name, offer a way to fix it fast.
    * square
* Can you not even with "Real Names"?
    * quote from LL VP about reputations
    * assuming ill intent
* The state is transphobic by nature.
* Even if the state is transphobic, you don't need to be.
* Offer workarounds: Display Names and Preferred Names
    * Kaiser/EPIC
        * Kaiser patient management software allows for preferred names
    * Second Life
        * Display names added in 2010 as a work around for difficulty of changing name 
  * But display names preferred names are inconsistent
    * Software that displays preferred name only accessed by clinical staff, clerks 
      and front office staff see only 3270 terminal with legal name
    * Scripts in SL have to account for SL 
* If I change my name once, change it everywhere
   * amazon
   * paypal
